Elrond and his twin brother Elros were captured and raised by Maglor a Son of Fëanor.|{'entities': [(0, 6, 'PERSON'), (28, 33, 'PERSON'), (62, 68, 'PERSON')]}
Though at first there was no great love between them, eventually Maglor took pity on them and cherished them, and eventually grew to love them.[1]|{'entities': [(65, 71, 'PERSON')]}
By the end of the First Age and the War of Wrath, the Sons of Fëanor were again working alone, suggesting that by this time Elrond and Elros had left their nominal captivity and traveled to Lindon.|{'entities': [(124, 130, 'PERSON'), (135, 140, 'PERSON'), (54, 68, 'PERSON'), (190, 196, 'PERSON')]}

In SA 1695, Elrond was sent to Eregion by Gil-galad in an attempt to protect it from the invading forces of Sauron.|{'entities': [(12, 18, 'PERSON'), (108, 114, 'PERSON')]}
Unfortunately, Elrond's host was too weak and was unable to hold off Sauron's army.|{'entities': [(15, 21, 'PERSON'), (69, 75, 'PERSON')]}
He retreated north with a host of elves out of Eregion including Celeborn and remained ever watchful of Sauron from there.|{'entities': [(65, 73, 'PERSON'), (104, 110, 'PERSON')]}
It was during the following two years (SA 1697) that Elrond founded Rivendell at the feet of the Misty Mountains, which survived as one of the last remaining strongholds against Sauron at the end of the Third Age.[4][5]|{'entities': [(53, 59, 'PERSON'), (178, 184, 'PERSON')]}
After the combined forces of the elves under Gil-Galad, Cirdan, Elrond and the Men of Númenor defeated Sauron in SA 1701|{'entities': [(64, 70, 'PERSON'), (103, 109, 'PERSON')]}
Elrond remained in Rivendell and hosted the first White Council, attended by Galadriel, at which it was decided that Elrond's home, the Last Homely House, would remain the last stronghold west of the Misty Mountains, and that the Three Rings then held by Gil-Galad and Galadriel would remain hidden.|{'entities': [(0, 6, 'PERSON'), (77, 86, 'PERSON')]}
According to one account Gil-Galad at this time gave Elrond Vilya the Blue Ring, though in other accounts Gil-Galad kept both Narya and Vilya until the end of the Second Age.|{'entities': [(53, 65, 'PERSON')]}

Elrond was Gil-galad's herald during the war against Sauron.|{'entities': [(0, 6, 'PERSON'), (53, 59, 'PERSON')]}

Eventually, Sauron himself was defeated by Elendil and Gil-galad, allowing Isildur to cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger and claim the Ring for himself.|{'entities': [(43, 50, 'PERSON'), (75, 82, 'PERSON'), (12, 18, 'PERSON')]}
Gil-Galad, Elendil, and his younger son Anarion were killed in the siege.|{'entities': [(11, 18, 'PERSON')]}
Elrond and Cirdan only remained as the commanders of the elves, and Isildur as lord of men.|{'entities': [(0, 6, 'PERSON'), (68, 75, 'PERSON')]}
Upon discovering that Isildur had claimed the One Ring for himself Elrond urged Isildur to throw the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, but the seduction of the ring made Isildur refuse.|{'entities': [(67, 73, 'PERSON'), (22, 29, 'PERSON')]}
Isildur claimed the Ring as a Weregild for his father and brother, and Elrond (perhaps not fully understanding the nature of the One Ring) acknowledged his claim.|{'entities': [(71, 77, 'PERSON'), (0, 7, 'PERSON')]}
Isildur was then named High King of Gondor and Arnor and took his father's throne, while Elrond returned to Rivendell at the end of the war.[4]|{'entities': [(89, 95, 'PERSON'), (0, 7, 'PERSON')]}

Aragorn grew up in Imladris unaware of his kingly lineage until Elrond told him when he had reached his manhood.[8]|{'entities': [(64, 70, 'PERSON')]}
He also was a member of the White Council, which was often held in Rivendell, and was a great friend of Gandalf the Grey.|{'entities': [(104, 120, 'PERSON'), (4629, 4641, 'PERSON')]}
After Frodo's departure from the Shire with the One Ring, Elrond sent out riders to help guide him back to Rivendell.|{'entities': [(58, 64, 'PERSON')]}
One of these, Glorfindel, successfully found Frodo and helped him reach Rivendell.[10]|{'entities': [(14, 24, 'PERSON')]}
Later, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir with the Rangers of the North to Rohan.|{'entities': [(28, 35, 'PERSON'), (40, 47, 'PERSON'), (7, 13, 'PERSON')]}
Through his sons, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the Paths of the Dead.[12]|{'entities': [(18, 24, 'PERSON')]}
Elrond remained in Rivendell until the destruction of the One Ring and of Sauron, after which he went to Minas Tirith to surrender the Sceptre of Annúminas to King Elessar and give his daughter Arwen Undómiel away to be married.[13]|{'entities': [(194, 208, 'PERSON'), (0, 6, 'PERSON'), (74, 80, 'PERSON')]}

In FA 532, Elros was born in Arvernien.|{'entities': [(11, 16, 'PERSON')]}

They were both raised in love for Maglor was not proud of his deeds.|{'entities': [(34, 40, 'PERSON')]}
It is nowhere told when or if Elros and Elrond actually left Maglor|{'entities': [(40, 46, 'PERSON'), (30, 35, 'PERSON'), (61, 67, 'PERSON')]}
but it can be assumed that at the time of Eönwë's arrival they took full part in the war.[1]|{'entities': [(42, 47, 'PERSON')]}
In FA 547,[2] the host of Eönwë and the Valar were seen shining upon the sea and the noise of Eönwë`s trumpets rang over the waves.|{'entities': [(26, 31, 'PERSON')]}
Eönwë summoned all of the Elves and all of the men from Hithlum to the South, rallying them for the great war against Melkor that was now to come.[1]|{'entities': [(0, 5, 'PERSON')]}
As Elros and Elrond were Peredhil, or Half-elven, and only in these two remained the line of heroic chieftains of Men in the First Age.|{'entities': [(13, 19, 'PERSON'), (3, 8, 'PERSON')]}
The Valar gave to Elrond and Elros the choice of which kindred they would belong to.|{'entities': [(18, 24, 'PERSON'), (29, 34, 'PERSON')]}
Eonwë came among the faithful humans and he taught them and gave them wisdom, power, and a life longer than any others of mortal race, but none of the high men ever reached the age of Elros.|{'entities': [(184, 189, 'PERSON')]}
This land was Númenor, and Elros was its first king.[3]|{'entities': [(27, 32, 'PERSON')]}
When Elros was 90 years old, he ascended the throne of Númenor in the city of Armenelos where he was inscribed as Elros Tar-Minyatur.|{'entities': [(5, 10, 'PERSON')]}
The sword Aranrúth which once was his great-great-grandfather Thingol's sword, the Serpent Ring, and Dramborleg, the Axe of Tuor became heirlooms of the Kings of Númenor.[4]|{'entities': [(113, 128, 'PERSON')]}
During his time as king, Elros had four children to an unnamed mortal wife.|{'entities': [(25, 30, 'PERSON')]}

 Arwen was the Half-Elven daughter of Elrond and Celebrían.|{'entities': [(0, 7, 'PERSON'), (49, 58, 'PERSON'), (38, 44, 'PERSON')]}
"She was often called Arwen Undómiel or ""Evenstar""."|{'entities': [(21, 35, 'PERSON')]}
In marrying Aragorn II Elessar after the War of the Ring, she became Queen of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, and like Beren and Lúthien before her, she united Elf and Man in peaceful love and harmony, in the process becoming mortal.|{'entities': [(12, 30, 'PERSON'), (12, 30, 'PERSON'), (129, 134, 'PERSON'), (139, 146, 'PERSON')]}
Arwen was born in TA 241, to Lord Elrond and Lady Celebrían of Rivendell.[1]|{'entities': [(0, 5, 'PERSON'), (45, 59, 'PERSON'), (34, 40, 'PERSON')]}
During Aragorn's twentieth year, he met Arwen for the first time in Rivendell, where he lived under Elrond's protection.|{'entities': [(40, 45, 'PERSON'), (100, 106, 'PERSON')]}
Arwen, then over 2700 years old, had recently returned to her father's home after living for a while with her grandmother Galadriel in Lórien.|{'entities': [(0, 5, 'PERSON'), (122, 131, 'PERSON')]}
Aragorn fell in love with Arwen at first sight, and at first mistook her for Lúthien, thinking he had fallen into a dream.|{'entities': [(26, 31, 'PERSON'), (77, 84, 'PERSON')]}
"About thirty years later, the two were reunited in Lórien, where Arwen reciprocated Aragorn's love and they ""plighted their troth"" (promised themselves to each other) on the mound of Cerin Amroth, choosing to become mortal and to stay in Middle-earth with Aragorn, and giving up the chance to sail over the sea and live forever in the Blessed Realm."|{'entities': [(183, 195, 'PERSON'), (65, 70, 'PERSON')]}
Arwen never broke faith with Aragorn, even when he went to war.|{'entities': [(0, 5, 'PERSON')]}
While the War in the South raged on, Arwen wove a banner for Aragorn, which would become his standard after he became king.|{'entities': [(37, 42, 'PERSON')]}
Before taking the Paths of the Dead, Aragorn was met by a group consisting of Dúnedain, and Arwen's brothers, Elladan and Elrohir.|{'entities': [(92, 97, 'PERSON'), (110, 117, 'PERSON'), (122, 129, 'PERSON')]}
They brought to him a banner of black cloth: a gift made by Arwen, and a sign that encouraged him to take the difficult path.[2] When the banner was unfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to reveal the emblem of Elendil in Mithril, gems, and gold, it was the first triumphant announcement of the King's return.|{'entities': [(60, 65, 'PERSON'), (219, 237, 'PERSON')]}
Arwen arrived at Minas Tirith after Aragorn had become King of Gondor and Arnor, and they married on Midsummer's Day in the year TA 3019, after the end of the War of the Ring.|{'entities': [(0, 5, 'PERSON')]}
After marrying Aragorn, she bestowed upon Frodo Baggins a gift:|{'entities': [(42, 55, 'PERSON')]}
In the year 121 of the Fourth Age, after Aragorn's death, Arwen died of a broken heart at Cerin Amroth in Lórien,[3] and was buried there one year after the death of Aragorn, to whom she had been wedded for 122 years.|{'entities': [(96, 102, 'PERSON'), (58, 63, 'PERSON')]}

He was a great ranger and warrior, and as Isildur's heir he bore the shards of Narsil, reforged and renamed Andúril, in the War of the Ring.|{'entities': [(42, 49, 'PERSON')]}
He was Aragorn son of Arathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from Isildur, and yet more like Elendil than any before him.&#8212;The Silmarillion, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age Aragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur.|{'entities': [(110, 117, 'PERSON'), (231, 249, 'PERSON'), (83, 90, 'PERSON')]}
His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to Fíriel, who was descended from Anárion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of Anárion as well.|{'entities': [(66, 73, 'PERSON'), (94, 102, 'PERSON'), (13, 20, 'PERSON'), (35, 41, 'PERSON')]}
Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond.|{'entities': [(48, 54, 'PERSON')]}
At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known.|{'entities': [(166, 173, 'PERSON'), (186, 193, 'PERSON')]}
"Elrond revealed to ""Estel"" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil."|{'entities': [(102, 109, 'PERSON'), (0, 6, 'PERSON')]}
"Elrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he ""came of the right"" to possess the item."|{'entities': [(0, 6, 'PERSON')]}
It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of Lórien where she had visited her grandmother Galadriel.[1]|{'entities': [(68, 73, 'PERSON'), (75, 81, 'PERSON'), (184, 196, 'PERSON')]}
Heeding Gandalf's advice, Aragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Shire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian Hobbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Shire's borders as Strider.|{'entities': [(0, 17, 'PERSON'), (2164, 2169, 'PERSON')]}

Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of Sauron and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in the War of the Ring.|{'entities': [(87, 93, 'PERSON')]}
Later in 2980, he visited Lórien, and there once again met Arwen.|{'entities': [(59, 64, 'PERSON')]}
"He gave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the hill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Men; death.[1] Elrond withheld from Aragorn permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of ""both"" Gondor and Arnor."|{'entities': [(80, 92, 'PERSON'), (94, 99, 'PERSON'), (51, 58, 'PERSON'), (208, 214, 'PERSON')]}
As both Elrond and Aragorn knew, to marry a mortal, Arwen would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Elrond of his daughter while the world lasted.|{'entities': [(52, 57, 'PERSON'), (8, 14, 'PERSON')]}
Elrond was also concerned for Arwen's own happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and that of her beloved) too difficult to bear.[1]|{'entities': [(30, 35, 'PERSON'), (0, 6, 'PERSON')]}
"What his right name is I've never heard: but he's known round here as Strider.&#8212;Barliman Butterbur, speaking of Aragorn in The Fellowship of the Ring, ""At the Sign of the Prancing Pony"" Aragorn joined Frodo Baggins, Bilbo's adopted heir, and three of his friends at the Inn of the Prancing Pony in Bree.[4]"|{'entities': [(206, 219, 'PERSON')]}
The elf-lord Glorfindel later arrived and led them to Rivendell.[7]|{'entities': [(13, 23, 'PERSON')]}
Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo, the company included Frodo's cousins Pippin and Merry, his best friend Samwise Gamgee, Legolas the elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor.[3]  Before the group set out, the shards of Narsil were reforged, and the restored blade was named Andúril.|{'entities': [(162, 169, 'PERSON'), (108, 122, 'PERSON'), (124, 131, 'PERSON')]}
He helped protect Frodo from an Orc captain and became the Fellowship's leader after Gandalf was presumed lost in battle with a Balrog.[8]|{'entities': [(85, 92, 'PERSON'), (5332, 5335, 'PERSON')]}
Aragorn then led the company to Lórien, where Lady Galadriel gave him the Elfstone.[9]|{'entities': [(46, 60, 'PERSON')]}
After passing into the Argonath, the Fellowship camped in Amon Hen.|{'entities': [(23, 31, 'PERSON')]}
Frodo saw that Boromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One Ring trying to take it.|{'entities': [(15, 22, 'PERSON')]}
Frodo put the ring on, rendering him invisible, and ran away from Boromir.|{'entities': [(66, 73, 'PERSON')]}
Frodo climbed to the high seat on Amon Hen; from there he could see Sauron's eye looking for him.|{'entities': [(68, 74, 'PERSON')]}
The Hobbit felt the eye but it was distracted by Gandalf the White, later found in Fangorn Forest by Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli during their search for Merry and Pippin.[citation needed] Frodo struggled against the power of Sauron before finally managing to take the ring off.|{'entities': [(110, 117, 'PERSON'), (49, 56, 'PERSON'), (6095, 6098, 'PERSON'), (225, 231, 'PERSON')]}
At this same time, the others were attacked by Saruman's Uruk-hai and a battle ensued.|{'entities': [(47, 54, 'PERSON')]}
During the ensuing battle, Boromir was killed defending Merry and Pippin and giving up his desire for the ring in a last attempt to resist the ring.|{'entities': [(27, 34, 'PERSON')]}

In the fields of Rohan, the Three Hunters Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encountered Éomer, who had recently been pursuing rumours of an orc raid in the area.|{'entities': [(82, 87, 'PERSON'), (51, 58, 'PERSON')]}
From Éomer, Aragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped Merry and Pippin had been destroyed and that the Hobbits had not been found.|{'entities': [(5, 19, 'PERSON')]}
Dejected, he led Legolas and Gimli to the site of the battle.|{'entities': [(17, 24, 'PERSON')]}
They did not find the Hobbits, but they did find Gandalf the White, sent back from Valinor to continue his struggle against Sauron.|{'entities': [(124, 130, 'PERSON')]}
Gandalf told the Three Hunters that the Hobbits were safe with the Ents of Fangorn.[13]|{'entities': [(0, 7, 'PERSON'), (7848, 7851, 'PERSON')]}
Together, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to Edoras, where Gandalf freed Théoden from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize the Rohirrim against Saruman.[14]|{'entities': [(67, 74, 'PERSON'), (8003, 8006, 'PERSON'), (94, 101, 'PERSON')]}
He allied with Théoden and led the refugees to Helm's Deep.|{'entities': [(15, 22, 'PERSON')]}
Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli then help the people of Rohan in the Battle of the Hornburg, in which they conclusively and victoriously defeated Saruman's army.[15]|{'entities': [(21, 26, 'PERSON'), (60, 86, 'PERSON'), (9, 16, 'PERSON'), (141, 148, 'PERSON')]}

Aragorn, being present with Gandalf, Theoden, Éomer, Legolas and Gimli, negotiated in a final parley with Saruman.|{'entities': [(46, 51, 'PERSON'), (65, 70, 'PERSON'), (53, 60, 'PERSON'), (28, 35, 'PERSON'), (8458, 8461, 'PERSON'), (106, 113, 'PERSON')]}
Saruman attempted to bend Theoden to his will, and at first the king was almost swayed, but mastering his will he refused to join with Saruman.|{'entities': [(0, 7, 'PERSON')]}
Saruman also attempted to sway Gandalf, but failed in this also, and even so Gandalf offered his counterpart the opportunity for forgiveness.|{'entities': [(31, 38, 'PERSON'), (8720, 8723, 'PERSON'), (0, 7, 'PERSON')]}
Saruman refused to repent out of pride, and thus Gandalf broke Saruman's staff and banished him from the Order of Wizards and The White Council.|{'entities': [(49, 56, 'PERSON'), (8880, 8883, 'PERSON'), (0, 7, 'PERSON')]}
After Saruman crawled away, Grima Wormtongue threw the Palantír of Orthanc at Gandalf as he and the others began to leave Orthanc.|{'entities': [(51, 85, 'PERSON'), (9054, 9057, 'PERSON'), (6, 13, 'PERSON')]}

It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that the Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying Gondor a millennia before.|{'entities': [(26, 33, 'PERSON')]}

Shortly a year after Aragorn died, Arwen soon died of a broken heart.|{'entities': [(35, 40, 'PERSON')]}
Falmari (House of Olwë)  |{'entities': [(9, 22, 'PERSON')]}
Galadriel was the co-ruler and Lady of Lothlórien alongside her husband, Lord Celeborn - however, neither of them took royal titles, as they only saw themselves as the Guardians of The Golden Wood.|{'entities': [(78, 96, 'PERSON'), (0, 9, 'PERSON')]}
She was the only daughter and youngest child of Finarfin, prince of the Ñoldor and of Eärwen, whose cousin was Lúthien.|{'entities': [(86, 92, 'PERSON'), (48, 56, 'PERSON'), (111, 118, 'PERSON')]}
Her elder brothers were Finrod Felagund,  Orodreth, Angrod, and Aegnor.[2]|{'entities': [(64, 73, 'PERSON'), (51, 58, 'PERSON'), (24, 39, 'PERSON'), (41, 50, 'PERSON')]}
Galadriel was a niece of Fëanor, one of the most important elves of the First Age.|{'entities': [(25, 31, 'PERSON')]}
Much of Galadriel's story is confusing, and there are several distinct tales told about her collected in the Unfinished Tales.|{'entities': [(8, 17, 'PERSON')]}
According to the older account, used in the published Silmarillion, Galadriel was an eager participant and leader in the rebellion of the Ñoldor and their flight from Valinor due to her desire to one day rule over a patch of Middle-earth herself.|{'entities': [(68, 77, 'PERSON')]}
She was eager to see Middle-earth, having heard of it from Fëanor, and wanted to rule a realm of her own.|{'entities': [(59, 65, 'PERSON')]}
She swore no oaths and was like minded with her cousin Fingon, son of Fingolfin.[1]|{'entities': [(55, 61, 'PERSON')]}
However, separated from Fëanor and his kin, she and her people did not take part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë.|{'entities': [(24, 30, 'PERSON')]}
They followed Fingolfin instead and crossed the Helcaraxë in the far north.[1]|{'entities': [(14, 23, 'PERSON')]}
Once in Beleriand, she lived nominally with one of her brothers, most likely Finrod, but spent much time at the court of Thingol and Melian in Menegroth, where she arrived in FA 52 and was welcomed because of her family relationship to Thingol's brother Olwë, Galadriel's maternal grandfather.|{'entities': [(77, 83, 'PERSON'), (260, 269, 'PERSON'), (254, 258, 'PERSON')]}
She met Celeborn, a kinsman of Thingol, in Doriath.[2]|{'entities': [(8, 16, 'PERSON'), (43, 53, 'PERSON')]}
She also traveled to visit her brother, Finrod, in his realm of Nargothrond multiple times.|{'entities': [(40, 46, 'PERSON')]}
Galadriel only briefly narrated the story to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar.|{'entities': [(75, 80, 'PERSON')]}
She dwelt in Nargothrond with her brother Finrod, and asked him if he would take no wife.|{'entities': [(42, 48, 'PERSON')]}
But Finrod had taken an oath only for himself, and his beloved had been left in Valinor.[3]|{'entities': [(4, 10, 'PERSON')]}
Celeborn and Galadriel traveled first to Lindon, where they ruled over a group of Elves as a fiefdom under Gil-galad.|{'entities': [(0, 8, 'PERSON'), (13, 22, 'PERSON'), (41, 47, 'PERSON')]}
Sometime later, they had a daughter, Celebrían.|{'entities': [(37, 46, 'PERSON')]}
Galadriel took an immediate distrust to Annatar, and it later turned out that this mistrust was justified, as he was finally revealed to be Sauron.|{'entities': [(140, 146, 'PERSON')]}
It was she who counseled Celebrimbor in the hiding of the rings, and when Eregion was attacked, Galadriel was entrusted with one of the Three Rings of the Elves.|{'entities': [(96, 105, 'PERSON')]}
Conscious of Sauron's power, and wishing to thwart it, she did not openly use the powers of her ring as long as the One Ring was in Sauron's hands.|{'entities': [(13, 19, 'PERSON')]}
Through Celebrían's wedding to Elrond, Galadriel was the grandmother of Elladan, Elrohir, and Arwen.|{'entities': [(94, 99, 'PERSON'), (8, 17, 'PERSON'), (72, 79, 'PERSON'), (81, 88, 'PERSON'), (31, 37, 'PERSON'), (39, 48, 'PERSON')]}
The tales tell little of Galadriel or of Celeborn during many centuries in the Third Age, but after the formation of the White Council in TA 2463 she put forth her might in opposition of Sauron.|{'entities': [(41, 49, 'PERSON'), (25, 34, 'PERSON'), (187, 193, 'PERSON')]}
After Sauron was ousted from his fortress of Dol Guldur, Lórien kept vigilance over the region until the time of the War of the Ring.|{'entities': [(6, 12, 'PERSON')]}
During the War of the Ring, Galadriel hosted the Fellowship of the Ring after their escape from the mines of Moria.|{'entities': [(28, 37, 'PERSON')]}
Once in Caras Galadhon, Galadriel allowed Frodo and Sam to peer into the Mirror of Galadriel, enabling them to glimpse possible events of the future.|{'entities': [(24, 33, 'PERSON')]}
She, in turn, was tested when Frodo Baggins later offered to place the One Ring in her keeping.|{'entities': [(30, 43, 'PERSON')]}
Gimli, in particular, was touched by Galadriel's lordliness and beauty, and asks for one strand of her golden hair as an heirloom of his house; she generously gave him three, which he later set in an impregnable crystal.|{'entities': [(37, 46, 'PERSON')]}
Apart from the strands of hair given to Gimli, she gave a Mallorn seed and a small box of earth from her garden to Samwise Gamgee; a green stone set in silver to Aragorn, along with a scabbard for his sword; and a belt each to Boromir, Merry, and Pippin. |{'entities': [(227, 234, 'PERSON'), (115, 129, 'PERSON'), (58, 65, 'PERSON')]}
To Legolas she gave a long, stout bow of the Galadhrim.|{'entities': [(3, 10, 'PERSON')]}
To Frodo she gave a magical phial, which captured the light of Eärendil's star, without which Frodo and Sam would have been unable to pass through Shelob's lair to complete their quest.|{'entities': [(63, 71, 'PERSON')]}
After the departure of the Fellowship, Galadriel acted to ensure the success of the quest.|{'entities': [(39, 48, 'PERSON')]}
It was she who summoned Gwaihir to rescue Gandalf off the peak of Celebdil, and it was she who nursed him back to health, dressing him in white, symbolizing his status as the new leader of the order.  |{'entities': [(42, 49, 'PERSON'), (7739, 7742, 'PERSON')]}
As Sauron put forth all his power during the end of the War of the Ring, he was aware of the threat of the Elves and their ancient potency, so he sent armies to besiege many of their settlements in the North while simultaneously assailing the major cities of Men and Dwarves.|{'entities': [(3, 9, 'PERSON')]}
Lórien itself was assaulted three times, but the armies of Dol Guldur were driven back due to the courage of the Elves and the power of Galadriel's Ring.|{'entities': [(136, 152, 'PERSON')]}
It is said that the power of her Ring could not be overcome unless Sauron himself would come to do battle.|{'entities': [(67, 73, 'PERSON')]}
After the fall of Sauron she, with Thranduil of Mirkwood and their elven allies, crossed the Anduin into Dol Guldur, where they tore down its walls and laid bare its pits.|{'entities': [(35, 56, 'PERSON'), (8619, 8634, 'PERSON'), (18, 24, 'PERSON')]}
She then traveled to Minas Tirith for the wedding of King Aragorn and Lady Arwen, and continued living in Lórien until TA 3021 when she traveled to the Grey Havens and, with the remaining Ring-bearers, took a ship and returned at last to the Undying Lands whence she had come so long ago.[6][7]|{'entities': [(70, 80, 'PERSON')]}
